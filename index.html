                   <h1>My Personal understanding of Yoga. </h1>
                     <p> Yoga is about finding balance between the body and mind. It's a physical, mental and even spiritual exersise <i>You don't need to be Spiricoco before you can do yoga. lol. </i> <br> It's a personal journey which is more than just putting the body in 'weird' positions. These positions are called ASANAS.</p>
                     <p> Yoga has origins from Ancient India. Anybody can do Yoga, young or old, overweight, underweight or fit , male or female. Think of it as your regular body fitness exercise. </p>
                     <p> Male Yoga practitioners are referred to as <i> YOGIS</i> while the female practitoners are <i> YOGINIS.</i> </p>

                        <p>Personally, I don't like labels so everyone is a <i> <b> YOGI </b></i> to me. </p>
